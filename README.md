# Music Tags Project
This folder contains research I did from 2014-2015 on clustering [folksonomic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy) data from Last.fm. The project includes topic modelling, hierarchical and SOM clustering.

## Last.fm command-line tools
During this time I also created some useful command-line tools to interact with Last.fm data:

- `scrobble.py`
- `recommend.py`
