# Music Tags Project
This folder contains research I did from 2014-2015 on clustering [folksonomic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy) data from Last.fm. 

## Last.fm command-line tools
During this time I also created some useful command-line tools to interact with Last.fm data:

- `scrobble.py`
- `recommend.py`

## Explanatory IPython notebooks
- Generalized Karger's *k*-cut
- fdas

$f(x) = x + 1$
